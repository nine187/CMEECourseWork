\section{Introduction}
    This report attempts to find a correlation between the annual temperature of Key West, Florida across the years and determine whether there is any significant difference changes in the temperature.

\section{Results and Discussion}
    The correlation coefficient was calculated at 0.533 and the fraction of the random correlation coefficients that were greater than the observed one after 1000 random correlation coefficient is 0.000 which indicate that the correlation is statistically significant. The result suggested that there could be a temporal factor that influence the annual temperature in Key West. However, futher investigion within the the temporal corelation should be investigated to further confirm or deny this finding.
