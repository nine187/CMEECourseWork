#1 cd back to the fasta file and use wordcount commant to count the individual files in there

cd ../data/fasta; wc -l 407228326.fasta 407228412.fasta E.coli.fasta 

#2 use tail -n\+2 which ignores the first line of the fasta file

tail -n\+2 E.coli.fasta 

#3 use grep to find the exact match of all the nucleotide with -o command and use word count -l to show the sequence length

grep -o 'A\|T\|C\|G' E.coli.fasta  | wc -l 

#4 use grep -o to find the exact sequence in the genome and use word count -l to show the number of matches found with grep command

grep -o 'ATGC' E.coli.fasta | wc -l

#5 use echo to show the AT/CG ratio within the echo there is 2 main chunks of code, the first one is for AT which use tail to read the
sequence from the second line at the data file then remove the breakline with \n and grep to find the A&T ratio along with wc -l to find the frequency of the
AT in the sequence and divided by the same method at for CG frequency

echo $(tail -n\+2 ../data/fasta/E.coli.fasta | tr -d '\n' | grep -o "A\|T" | wc -l) / $(tail -n\+2 ../data/fasta/E.coli.fasta | tr -d '\n' | grep -o "G\|C" | wc -l) | bc -l
