#1 cd back to the fasta file (that will be the default directory for the codes below) and use wordcount -l to count the lines

cd ../data/fasta; wc -l 407228326.fasta 407228412.fasta E.coli.fasta 

#2 use tail -n\+2 which ignores the first line of the fasta file and print the rest of the sequence

tail -n\+2 E.coli.fasta 

#3 use tail -n\+2 to read from the second line and tr -d to remove the line break, and wc -m to count all the letters

tail -n\+2 E.coli.fasta |tr -d "\n" | wc -m

#4 use grep -o to find the exact sequence in the genome, use tr -d to remove the line break and use word count -m to show the number of matches found 
with grep command

grep -o 'ATGC' E.coli.fasta |tr -d "\n" |wc -m

#5 use echo to show the AT/CG ratio within the echo there is 2 main chunks of code, the first one is for AT wchich use tail to read the
sequence from the second line at the data file then remove the breakline with \n and use grep to find the A&T ratio along with wc -l to find the
frequency of the AT in the sequence and divided by the same method at for CG frequency

echo $(tail -n\+2 E.coli.fasta | tr -d '\n' | grep -o "A\|T" | wc -l) / $(tail -n\+2 E.coli.fasta | tr -d '\n' | grep -o "G\|C" | wc -l) | bc -l
