# CMEE Coursework Repository

*Author: Pasith Prayoonrat*

*Created: Oct 2022*

This repository contains all the work attempted by Pasith within the Computational Methods in Ecology and Evolution (CMEE) Course.

Visitors who wish to attempt the coursework can refer to https://mhasoba.github.io/TheMulQuaBio/intro.html

Each individual subdirectory will contain their own READMEs detailing the contents within the week. Also located within each subdirectories are another 3 subdirectories /Code, /Results and /Data. /Code contains the scripts, /Results contains the output from the scripts and /Data contains input files for the scripts. One point to highlight is that if input files are only manipulated (e.g. changing file type and/or replacing separators), the output remains in /Data. Outputs are only directed to /Results when the input files were processed (e.g. generating a graph from a dataset).
